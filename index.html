  <h2>What is Soccer?</h2>
    <p>Soccer, also known as football, is a team sport in which two teams of eleven players compete on a rectagular field, a pitch, to score the most goals in a given amount of time by shooting the ball into the net, which is defended by a goalkeeper.</p>
  <h3> There are many ways to score, but here are a few important ones:</h3>
    <p>1. Free kicks</p>
    <p>2. Penalty kicks</p>
    <p>3. Corner kicks</p>
  <h2>The History</h2>
    <p>The origin of the sport is not completely certain, as some speculate it could have originiated in ancient China, Greece, Rome, and Mesoamerica. In mesoamerica for example, evidence of a team game similar to soccer comes from the various Mesoamerican cultures, such as the ritual ball game of the Aztecs, <i>ōllamaliztli.</i></p>
    <p>The popular version of soccer, or football, began its development in 12th century England, which consisted of a much aggressive and violent sport. Thus, it was banned in England for a long time. </p>
    <p>After the centuries-long ban, football was restored as a school sport with safer rules. It was played by several English schools but the problem was that there were no standard rules for the sport with each school playing by their won rules. Thus, a meeting at Cambridge in 1848 was held to help standardize the rules of the game.</p>
    <p>In 1863, the first Football Association was formed in England, establishing football as a standardized sport. The first football competitions were held such as the Football Association Challenge Cup. Thus, the sport rapidly spread to the rest of Europe and later traveled across the Atlantic to the Americas through immigrants</p>
    <p>The International Federation of Association Football (FIFA), as we know today, was estbalished in 1904, and in 1908, football became an official sport in the Olympic Games. In 1930, the first FIFA World Cup was held in Uruguay.</p>
    <p>Today, football stands as a sport that is embraced globally. It unifies millions of players and fans across the world through a shared passion for the sport.</p>

    <p><i>"I have many years to get better and better, and that has to be my ambition. The day you think there is no improvements to be made is a sad one for any player."</i> -Lionel Messi </p>
