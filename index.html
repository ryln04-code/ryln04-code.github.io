  <h2>What is Soccer?</h2>
    <p>Soccer, also known as football, is a team sport in which two teams of eleven players compete on a rectagular field, a pitch, to score the most goals in a given amount of time by shooting the ball into the net, which is defended by a goalkeeper.</p>
  <h3> There are many ways to score, but here are a few important ones:</h3>
    <p>1. Free kicks</p>
    <p>2. Penalty kicks</p>
    <p>3. Corner kicks</p>
  <h2>The History</h2>
    <p>The origin of the sport is not completely certain, as some speculate it could have originiated in ancient China, Greece, Rome, or even Mesoamerica</p>
